To address this challenge, a deep learning‐based technique was developed to minimize such residual motion effects. The technique combines a deep learning-based parameter estimation algorithm, using a hierarchical convolutional neural network (H-CNN), with motion assessment and corrupted volume rejection.</h2>

<p>Retrospective motion correction techniques are not perfect, inevitably retaining some residual
artifacts, the extent of which depends on the level of motion in a scan. These residual effects of head motion can compromise model fitting, introducing bias to model-derived measures.</p>

<p>Under the stringent thresholds, the H-CNN-based technique outperforms both WLLS and IRLLS, despite the number of its retained DWIs being considerably smaller than that of the full data. Moreover, its RMSEs for these subjects are similar, despite the levels of motion and the numbers of retained DWIs are different between them, demonstrating its robustness to different levels of motion.</p>
