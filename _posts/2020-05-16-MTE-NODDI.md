# Multi-TE NODDI for disentangling non-T2-weighted signal fractions from compartment-specific T2 relaxation times

## DOI to the paper: [link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116906)

## Conventional NODDI-derived compartment fractions are T2-weighted and TE-dependent, motivating the need for a model that can disentangle compartment fractions from compartment-specific T2 relaxation times.

As demonstrated above, *fin* increases with TE in all WM ROIs but remains relatively constant in the GM ROI; *fiso* increases with TE in all WM and GM ROIs; in contrast, *ODI* shows minimal TE-dependence.

The simulation data demonstrates the accuracy and precision of MTE-NODDI, and the in vivo data demonstrates the TE-dependence of NODDI estimated parameters and the ability of MTE-NODDI to exploit such TE-dependence. Compared to NODDI estimates, the estimates from MTE-NODDI suggest that conventional T2-weighted signal fractions will give overestimated relative intra-neurite and CSF fractions, due to the estimated T2 of intra-neurite compartment being larger than that of extra-neurite compartment from the proposed technique, and T2 of free water being larger than T2 of intra-neurite compartment in studies respectively.

When reducing the number of TEs while keeping the same TE range, the accuracy and precision of parameter estimation closely mirror those of the full data, including the slight biases.

## MTE-NODDI can help improve imaging studies of brain development, maturation, and aging, where T2 changes may accompany microstructure alterations. 

For future applications, the MTE-NODDI could be beneficial to the understanding and interpretability of neuroimaging studies, especially for those investigating age-related brain alterations, in which substantial alterations of T2-weighted intra-neurite fraction and T2 relaxation time have been reported throughout the lifespan. For example, the T2-weighted intra-neurite fractions have been shown to increase during brain development (Kansagra et al., 2016) and maturation (Geeraert et al., 2019; Mah et al., 2017), followed with a plateau at adulthood (Kodiweera et al., 2016) and to decrease during aging (Cox et al., 2016; Merluzzi et al., 2016). In contrast, the T2 values in WM have been shown to decrease quickly during early development and decrease slower during maturation (Ding et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2018), followed by increasing in most brain regions and declining in a few regions during aging (Kumar et al., 2012). However, the intrinsic microstructural changes behind the development process remain unclear due to the limitations of conventional single TE method. With the ability to disentangle the T2-weighted signal fraction from T2 weighting, the MTE-NODDI developed in this study can be applied.
