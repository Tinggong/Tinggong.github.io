# Deep learning-based method for reducing residual motion effects in diffusion parameter estimation

## DOI to the paper: [link](https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.28544)

## Retrospective motion correction techniques are not perfect, inevitably retaining some residual artifacts, the extent of which depends on the level of motion in a scan. These residual effects of head motion can compromise model fitting, introducing bias to model-derived measures. This can negatively impact downstream group-level studies if the level of motion is different between groups. For example, such residual effects following registration-based motion correction have been shown to introduce spurious group differences in DTI-derived measures (Yendiki A, et al., NeuroImage, 2014).

## To address the challenge of residual motion effects, the data-rejection approach was adopted in which motion-corrupted data are discarded before model-fitting. A deep learning-based parameter estimation algorithm, using a hierarchical convolutional neural network (H-CNN), was combined with motion assessment and corrupted volume rejection. The method was designed to overcome the limitations of existing methods of this kind that produce parameter estimations whose quality depends strongly on a proportion of the data discarded.

## The proposed H-CNN-based technique is minimally sensitive to motion effects regardless of the motion levels of different subjects.

Under the stringent thresholds, the H-CNN-based technique outperforms both WLLS and IRLLS, despite the number of its retained DWIs being considerably smaller than that of the full data. Moreover, its RMSEs for these subjects are similar, despite the levels of motion and the numbers of retained DWIs are different between them, demonstrating its robustness to different levels of motion.
